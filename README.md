# Challenge-19-assignment: Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## Description
This application is a text-editor that runs in a browser. The app's first inclination is to use the data from the indexedDB in the editor. If this can not be supported, then local storage will be used. It is able to run offline as well as online.
## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
